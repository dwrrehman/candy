bg() drafts.

what we have 

txflsetstep function:
    - move the a particialr stepper motor once in a specific direction 
    - relax the motor if desired. not calling the function holds the motor at one posistion
        - the standing posistion is held after the init sequence finishes. boot state of motor is 0. (relaxed)
    - function knows when the motor has went past its limit and regects movement if it causes motor to go outofbound;


what the bg() needs to do:

    - it needs to call all the motor functions into a thread
    - it needs to put up an interface for the htm to work with. (ie a decoder)
    - it needs some descion logic of which command to execute from either vs() or htm()
        - vs will 





   htm motor interface:

    - the connection between a particular neuron and the bg must be learned. 
         - learning rules:
               - each neron in htmoutput has a potential pool that it can connect to. 
               - if an htmouput appears twice in a row, increment the permanance of the synapse 
               - ...
    - there is a possible connection (or connnections) that result in the motor movement of every single motor on the body. 
        - the vs() influence on htm motor output is parrelleled by the addition of a vestiular ocular reflex ( vor(); ) which will generally have prioirty over 


        htm 00001000000010000000000001000010000000000001000000000000000001000000...000

	

htm.dt:

becuase input always arrives at L6 and then goes to l5, L6's function might be "to choose whether or not it wants to move a motor" based on the current input.
ie, a form of attention. 

i still have to implement the thalamus,
