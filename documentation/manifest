this is a large document for planning the software architechure of the robot candy.

	- research control theory. 
	- research function of hippocapmus
	- thal integration / lgn=term-spot-for-vision
	- emotion as it relates to the thalamus
	- - (but define "emotion" as the combination and use of pleasue and pain neurtransmitters)

--------------------------------------- notes -------------------------------------------


cranial nerves carries sensory input into, and motor commands out of the brain.

brainstem regulates autonomic nervous system functions, 
most of which are irrelvant to the robot.

bn is strongly linnked with the bs, n, and t.
 its functions include: 
	control of voluntary motor movements, 
	procedural learning, 
	routine behaviors or "habits"
	eye movements, 

vestibulo-ocular reflex:
	- the system deals with the ny motor, primarily,
	- the y axis of the gyroscopic data is translated into the movements for the ny motor.
	- the same system can be used for the x axis- you just need to use the nx motor, and the x axis data on the gyro.
	- ... has to do wth the superior colliculi

diencephalon - relays and processes sensory information, controls emtions, autonomic function ,

midbrain - procoesses autodry and visual dataand generates involutary motor responses

pons - a tract and relay center , 
the pons relay signals from the forebrain to the cerebellum, about info pertaining to:
	sleep, 
	hearing, 
	posture.






the cerebellum ia responsible for involtunary and voltunary motor activitie bassed on memory and sensory input

componets of motor control:
	desired actions - conscious/unconscious
	balance, and stabllization - unconscious
